Sanston University was founded in 1977 with the aim of providing education in an atmosphere of a home away from home. The university was built on an expansive 40 acres of land and is situated along the Thika Super Highway. The founders envisioned very high academic and developmental standards with the aim of producing well-adjusted members of a global community who are prepared to actively assume their roles and positively impact their communities.<br>
